  <h1>Verifying the DaisyNFS concurrent and crash-safe file system
  with sequential reasoning</h1>
  <h2>OSDI presentation</h2>
  <p>Here are the <a href=
  "../papers/daisy-nfs:osdi22-slides.pdf">slides for the OSDI
  presentation.</a> Come watch the talk on Tuesday at 3:15pm!</p>
  <h2>Further reading</h2>
  <p>We have an <a href="../papers/daisy-nfs:osdi22.pdf">OSDI 2022
  paper</a> describing the design and proof of DaisyNFS. For many
  more details, you can read Tej's <a href=
  "../papers/tchajed-thesis.pdf">PhD thesis</a>.</p>
  <p>Here's the abstract for the paper:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This paper develops a new approach to verifying a performant
    file system that isolates crash safety and concurrency
    reasoning to a transaction system that gives atomic access to
    the disk, so that the rest of the file system can be verified
    with <em>sequential reasoning</em>.</p>
    <p>We demonstrate this approach in DaisyNFS, a Network File
    System (NFS) server written in Go that runs on top of a disk.
    DaisyNFS uses GoTxn, a new verified, concurrent transaction
    system that extends GoJournal with two-phase locking and an
    allocator. The transaction system’s specifi- cation formalizes
    under what conditions transactions can be verified with only
    sequential reasoning, and comes with a mechanized proof in Coq
    that connects the specification to the implementation.</p>
    <p>As evidence that proofs enjoy sequential reasoning, DaisyNFS
    uses Dafny, a sequential verification language, to implement
    and verify all the NFS operations on top of GoTxn. The
    sequential proofs helped achieve a number of good properties in
    DaisyNFS: easy incremental development (for example, adding
    support for large files), a relatively short proof (only 2× as
    many lines of proof as code), and a per- formant implementation
    (at least 60% the throughput of the Linux NFS server exporting
    ext4 across a variety of benchmarks).</p>
