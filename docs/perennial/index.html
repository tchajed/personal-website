  <h2>SOSP paper</h2>

  <p><a href="../papers/perennial:sosp2019-slides.pdf"></a><a href=
  "../papers/perennial:sosp2019-slides.pdf">We have an</a> <a href=
  "../papers/perennial:sosp2019.pdf">SOSP 2019 paper</a> describing
  Perennial's techniques, the Goose translator, and a broad
  evaluation of several aspects of Perennial's implementation.</p>

  <p>Here's the abstract:</p>

  <blockquote>
    This paper introduces Perennial, a framework for verifying
    concurrent, crash-safe systems. Perennial extends the Iris
    concurrency framework with three techniques to enable
    crash-safety reasoning: recovery leases, recovery helping, and
    versioned memory. To ease development and deployment of
    applications, Perennial provides Goose, a subset of Go and a
    translator from that subset to a model in Perennial with
    support for reasoning about Go threads, data structures, and
    file-system primitives. We implemented and verified a
    crash-safe, concurrent mail server using Perennial and Goose
    that achieves speedup on multiple cores. Both Perennial and
    Iris use the Coq proof assistant, and the mail server and the
    framework's proofs are machine checked.
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Perennial source code</h2>

  <p>All of Perennial is open source. The implementation is split
  into multiple GitHub repos:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The framework and verified examples are at <a href=
    "https://github.com/mit-pdos/perennial"><tt>mit-pdos/perennial</tt></a>.</li>

    <li>The Goose translator, which imports Go into Coq for
    verification with Perennial, is at <a href=
    "https://github.com/tchajed/goose"><tt>tchajed/goose</tt></a>.
    The documentation in that repo goes into more detail than the
    SOSP paper on exactly how the translation works.</li>

    <li>The mail server we verified, Mailboat, is at <a href=
    "https://github.com/tchajed/mailboat">tchajed/mailboat</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Questions you might ask</h1>

  <h2>Why is it called Perennial?</h2>

  <p>We extend Iris, and irises (the flowers) are perennials, but
  also because perennials recover in the spring.</p>

  <h2>Why is it called Goose?</h2>

  <p>Because it translates from Go to Coq, and Coq means "rooster"
  in french, and a goose is like a rooster.</p>

  <h2>This is cool, how do I work on it?</h2>

  <p>This work is all based on Iris, a sophisticated and extensible
  Coq framework for concurrency. Talk to Tej or Joe Tassarotti and
  we can point you to some resources.</p>
